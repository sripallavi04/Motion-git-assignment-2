Launch: Click the Launch Instance button on the EC2 Dashboard to start the setup process.
4. Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)
Select AMI: Choose an Amazon Machine Image suitable for your needs. For a basic setup, select Amazon Linux 2 AMI (HVM), SSD Volume Type.
Free Tier: Ensure it is free-tier eligible if you aim to minimize costs.
5. Choose an Instance Type
Select Type: Choose the t2.micro instance type, which is sufficient for basic operations and covered under the free tier.
Proceed: Click Next: Configure Instance Details.
6. Configure Instance Details
Default Configuration: Accept the default settings unless specific changes are required for your use case.
Advanced Options: Configure advanced options if needed for specialized tasks or performance tuning.
Proceed: Click Next: Add Storage.
7. Add Storage
Default Storage: The default storage settings are typically sufficient. Verify the root volume size and type.
Volume Adjustments: Adjust the volume size if you need more storage space.
Proceed: Click Next: Add Tags.
8. Add Tags
Tagging: Optionally, add tags to manage and organize your instances. For instance, add a tag with Key: Name and Value: MyInstance.
Proceed: Click Next: Configure Security Group.
9. Configure Security Group
Create Security Group: Set up a new security group to control access to your instance.
Add Inbound Rules:
SSH Access: Add a rule to allow SSH access:
Type: SSH
Protocol: TCP
Port Range: 22
Source: My IP to restrict access to your current IP address, or Anywhere for broader access (consider security implications).
Review Rules: Ensure the security group settings match your requirements.
Proceed: Click Review and Launch.
10. Review Instance Launch
Final Review: Verify all settings to ensure they meet your needs.
Launch: Click Launch.
11. Create and Download Key Pair
Key Pair Creation: When prompted, create a new key pair. Name it and download the .pem file securely.
Store Safely: Save the .pem file in a safe location as you will use it to access your instance.
Launch Instances: Confirm and click Launch Instances.
12. Instance Provisioning
View Instances: Click on View Instances to see your new instance in the EC2 Dashboard.
Instance Status: Wait for the instance status to change to "running".
Connecting to Your Instance
1. Retrieve Public DNS or IP
Locate Instance: In the EC2 Dashboard, find your running instance and note its public DNS name or IP address.
2. Prepare for SSH Connection
Set File Permissions: Ensure your .pem file has the correct permissions:
sh
Copy Code


chmod 400 your-key-pair-file.pem
3. Connect via SSH
SSH Command: Open your terminal and connect using the following command:
sh
Copy Code


ssh -i "your-key-pair-file.pem" ec2-user@your-instance-public-dns
Login: This command logs you into your EC2 instance.
Optimization Tips:
Pre-Set Information: Prepare your key pair name and instance configuration details beforehand to streamline the setup process.
Security: Use specific IP restrictions in the security group to enhance security.
Tags: Adding descriptive tags helps manage and identify instances efficiently, especially useful for multiple instances.
Network Connection: Ensure a stable internet connection during the setup to prevent interruptions.
By following these steps and optimization tips, you'll set up an AWS instance efficiently, preparing it for deployment or further configuration tailored to your specific needs.


Certainly! Here is an optimized step-by-step guide to deploy and run a simple Python script that adds two numbers on an Amazon EC2 instance.

Steps to Deploy a Python Script on an EC2 Instance
1. SSH into Your EC2 Instance
Open Terminal: Use your terminal (or SSH client).
Navigate to .pem file location: Ensure you are in the directory where your .pem file is saved, and set correct permissions if not already done:
sh
Copy Code


chmod 400 your-key-pair-file.pem
Connect via SSH:
sh
Copy Code


ssh -i "your-key-pair-file.pem" ec2-user@your-instance-public-dns
2. Prepare the EC2 Instance
Update Packages: First, update the packages on your EC2 instance:
sh
Copy Code


sudo yum update -y
Install Python: Ensure Python is installed:
sh
Copy Code


sudo yum install python3 -y
3. Create Your Python Script
Create Script File: Create a new Python script file:

sh
Copy Code


nano add_numbers.py
Enter the Sample Script: Write (or paste) the following content into the file:

def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

if __name__ == "__main__":
    num1 = 10
    num2 = 20
    print(f"The sum of {num1} and {num2} is {add_numbers(num1, num2)}")
Save the File: Save and close the file by pressing Ctrl+X, then Y, and then Enter.

4. Run the Python Script
Run the Script: Execute the Python script using Python 3:
sh
Copy Code


python3 add_numbers.py
Verify Output
Output Verification: You should see an output similar to:
The sum of 10 and 20 is 30
Optimization Tips:
Automation: Consider using an automated script or cloud-init to set up your environment and deploy your Python script automatically.
Environment Isolation: Use virtual environments (e.g., venv) to manage dependencies if your script requires additional Python packages.
Secure Access: Limit SSH access to your instance from specific IPs to enhance security.
Consistent Environment: Use Docker or similar containerization tools if the script needs to run in a consistent environment across multiple deployments.
By following these steps, you can efficiently deploy and run a basic Python script on your EC2 instance, enabling you to extend this setup for more complex applications in the future.
